# pf_place_mapper
Visualize pixelfed locations on a map to find the closest one to your photos actual location.

Markers are loaded by country via a select to reduce the number of markers added to the map, loading up more causes lag. This could be improved but this is a dirty script to fix the problem of not knowing which place is closest to my photos actual location.
